## Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized key patterns and trends, highlighting features like `Contract Type`, `Tenure`, and `Monthly Charges`.
3. **Model Building**: Trained machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC.
5. **Insights and Recommendations**: Provided actionable strategies to address customer churn.

## Results
- **Random Forest Classifier** performed best with:
  - **Accuracy**: 75.35%
  - **AUC**: 0.84
- Customers with short contracts, high monthly charges, and low tenure are more likely to churn.

---

## Recommendations
- **Target High-Risk Customers**: Offer incentives for month-to-month customers to switch to long-term plans.
- **Personalized Offers**: Address pricing concerns through discounts or tailored retention strategies.
- **Early Engagement**: Focus on new customers to build loyalty early in their lifecycle.
